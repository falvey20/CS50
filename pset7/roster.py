#In roster.py, write a program that prints a list of students for a given house in alphabetical order.
#Your program should query the students table in the students.db database for all of the students in the specified house.
#Your program should then print out each studentâ€™s full name and birth year (formatted as, e.g., Harry James Potter, born 1980 or Luna Lovegood, born 1981).
#Each student should be printed on their own line.
#Students should be ordered by last name. For students with the same last name, they should be ordered by first name.
